# DUNS_webscraping_code

Thank you very much for using my code!!

This code only requires your email address and your input dataset.

The dataset I use contain two columns: "company_name" is the full name of each company that I want the DUNS number for. "state" is the abbreviate state name of
the headqurter of each company.

Please follow the instructions in my DUNS_Scrapping.ipynb code. If you encounter any issue, please feel free to email me at: zhengzhang1216@berkeley.edu
