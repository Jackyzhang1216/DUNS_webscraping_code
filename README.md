# DUNS_webscraping_code

This is the web scraping code for small business or research team to extract the unique DUNS id from dnb.com. Plase, DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE!

Thank you very much for using my code!!

This code only requires your email address and your input dataset.

The dataset I use contains two columns: "company_name" is the full name of each company that I want the DUNS number for. "state" is the abbreviate state name of
the headquarter of each company.

Please follow the instructions in my DUNS_Scrapping.ipynb code. If you encounter any issue, please feel free to email me at: zhengzhang1216@berkeley.edu
